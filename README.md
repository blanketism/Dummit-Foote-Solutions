# Solutions to Dummit Foote

An unofficial solutions manual for *Abstract Algebra, 3rd Edition*, by David S. and Richard M. Foote.

Please submit a pull request on your own fork of this repository if you have any changes you'd like to be implemented, and I will get to them as soon as I can to merge later on.

Much of the important messages necessary to be said are in the Preface of `dummit_foote_exercises.pdf`, but again, this is an ongoing project and I am no way affiliated with the authors.

## Downloads

- `dummit_foote_exercises.tex` is the main file that houses `\begin{document}...` and other files that are necessary to compile the entire document.
